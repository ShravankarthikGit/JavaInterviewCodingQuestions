1. Can traverse elements present in Collection only in the forward direction.	
Can traverse elements present in Collection both in forward and backward directions.


2. Helps to traverse Map, List and Set.

3. Indexes cannot be obtained by using Iterator.	
It has methods like nextIndex() and previousIndex() to obtain indexes of elements at any time while traversing List.

We can modify or replace elements with the help of set(E e)

5. Cannot add elements and it throws ConcurrentModificationException.	
Can easily add elements to a collection at any time.
